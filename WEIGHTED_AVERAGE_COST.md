# Weighted Average Cost (WAC) Implementation

## Overview

This system now implements **Weighted Average Cost (WAC)** for proper inventory cost management. This ensures accurate cost tracking when receiving stock at different prices.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when restocking at a different cost, ALL existing stock would be valued at the new cost, which was financially incorrect.

### Example of the Problem (OLD):

```
Day 1: Buy 10 units @ ₱100 = ₱1,000
Day 5: Buy 20 units @ ₱120 = ₱2,400

❌ OLD: All 30 units valued at ₱120 = ₱3,600 (WRONG - overvalued by ₱200)
```

## Solution: Weighted Average Cost

### How It Works

When receiving new stock at a different cost, the system calculates a weighted average:

```
Formula: WAC = (Old Value + New Value) / Total Quantity

Example:
Old Stock: 10 units @ ₱100 = ₱1,000
New Stock: 20 units @ ₱120 = ₱2,400
Total Value: ₱3,400
Total Units: 30

WAC = ₱3,400 ÷ 30 = ₱113.33 per unit ✅

Result: All 30 units valued at ₱113.33 = ₱3,400 (CORRECT)
```

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `receiveStockWithCost()`

Located in: `lib/providers/inventory_provider.dart`

This method:

1. ✅ Calculates weighted average cost
2. ✅ Updates product with new stock and WAC
3. ✅ Records cost history
4. ✅ Records price history (selling price)
5. ✅ Records stock movement with details
6. ✅ Works both online and offline

### Updated UI: Receive Stock Dialog

Located in: `lib/widgets/receive_stock_dialog.dart`

The dialog now:

1. ✅ Shows WAC calculation breakdown
2. ✅ Displays old cost vs new cost
3. ✅ Shows resulting weighted average cost
4. ✅ Requires user confirmation with full details

### Cost History Tracking

Cost history is now properly recorded:

- ✅ When creating a new product (initial cost)
- ✅ When updating product cost (online mode)
- ✅ When receiving stock with new cost (WAC)
- ✅ Both online and offline modes

## User Experience

### Receiving Stock with Different Cost

**Before:**

```
Old Stock: 10 @ ₱100
Receive: 20 @ ₱120
Result: 30 @ ₱120 ❌ (incorrect)
```

**After:**

```
Old Stock: 10 @ ₱100 = ₱1,000
Receive: 20 @ ₱120 = ₱2,400
--------------------------------
Weighted Average Cost Calculation:
Old: 10 × ₱100 = ₱1,000
New: 20 × ₱120 = ₱2,400
Total: ₱3,400 ÷ 30 = ₱113.33
--------------------------------
Result: 30 @ ₱113.33 ✅ (correct)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Accurate Inventory Valuation

- Inventory value reflects actual money spent
- No overvaluation or undervaluation

### 2. Correct COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

- Profit calculations are accurate
- Better financial reporting

### 3. Better Decision Making

- Know true product costs
- Set appropriate selling prices
- Understand actual profit margins

### 4. Complete Audit Trail

- All cost changes tracked in cost history
- Stock movements record WAC details
- Can trace back cost changes over time

## Financial Impact

### Example Business Scenario:

```
Month 1: Buy 100 units @ ₱50 = ₱5,000
Month 2: Buy 100 units @ ₱60 = ₱6,000
Total Investment: ₱11,000 for 200 units

Correct WAC: ₱11,000 ÷ 200 = ₱55/unit

If you sell 150 units @ ₱80:
Revenue: 150 × ₱80 = ₱12,000
COGS: 150 × ₱55 = ₱8,250
Profit: ₱3,750 ✅ (correct)

Without WAC (using latest cost ₱60):
COGS: 150 × ₱60 = ₱9,000
Profit: ₱3,000 ❌ (understated by ₱750)
```

## Technical Notes

### Database Changes

No schema changes required. The system uses existing:

- `products` table (cost field)
- `costHistory` collection
- `priceHistory` collection
- `stockMovements` collection

### Compatibility

- ✅ Works with existing data
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Online/offline mode support
- ✅ Handles version conflicts

### Performance

- Calculation is O(1) - instant
- No additional database queries needed
- Lightweight implementation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Upgrades:

1. **FIFO/LIFO Option** - For businesses that need batch tracking
2. **Lot/Batch Tracking** - Track individual batches with expiry dates
3. **Cost Trend Analysis** - Visualize cost changes over time
4. **Cost Variance Alerts** - Warn when costs change significantly

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:

1. No migration required
2. Existing products keep their current cost
3. WAC applies only to new stock receipts
4. Cost history starts recording from now

### Best Practices:

1. Always use "Receive Stock" dialog when restocking
2. Enter accurate cost for each batch
3. Review WAC calculation before confirming
4. Check cost history regularly
