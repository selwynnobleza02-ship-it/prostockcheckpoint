# FIFO Batch Tracking System - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

All objectives have been successfully implemented. Your ProStock inventory system now uses **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** batch tracking instead of WAC (Weighted Average Cost).

---

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Changes (v8 → v9)**

**New Table Created:**

```sql
inventory_batches (
  id, product_id, batch_number,
  quantity_received, quantity_remaining, unit_cost,
  date_received, supplier_id, notes,
  created_at, updated_at
)
```

**Modified Tables:**

- `products` - Added `selling_price` column (optional fixed price)
- `sale_items` - Added `batchId` and `batchCost` columns
- `credit_sale_items` - Updated to include batch tracking

**Migration:**

- Automatic upgrade on app launch
- Existing stock → Initial batches
- All old data preserved

---

### 2. **New Models**

**InventoryBatch** (`lib/models/inventory_batch.dart`)

- Represents each stock batch
- Tracks quantity received/remaining
- Records unit cost per batch
- Auto-generates unique batch numbers

**BatchAllocation** (`lib/models/batch_allocation.dart`)

- Helper for FIFO allocation logic
- Represents allocation from specific batch
- Used internally during sales

---

### 3. **Core FIFO Logic**

**BatchService** (`lib/services/batch_service.dart`)

Key Methods:

- `createBatch()` - Creates new batch when receiving stock
- `allocateStockFIFO()` - **Core FIFO algorithm** - allocates from oldest batches
- `reduceBatchQuantity()` - Reduces batch during sales
- `getBatchesByFIFO()` - Gets batches ordered oldest first
- `calculateAverageCost()` - Calculates weighted average for reference

**FIFO Algorithm:**

```dart
// Simplified logic
1. Get all batches with stock, sorted by date (oldest first)
2. For each batch:
   - Take quantity needed from this batch
   - If batch depleted, move to next batch
   - Continue until quantity fulfilled
3. Return list of batch allocations
```

---

### 4. **Sales Flow Changes**

**Before (WAC):**

```
Add Product → Single SaleItem with average cost
```

**After (FIFO):**

```
Add Product → FIFO Allocation → Multiple SaleItems (one per batch)

Example:
Customer buys 15 Coke
- 10 from Batch #001 @ ₱5.00 (oldest)
- 5 from Batch #002 @ ₱6.00 (next oldest)
Result: 2 sale items with exact batch costs
```

---

### 5. **Stock Receipt Flow**

**Before (WAC):**

```
Receive Stock → Calculate WAC → Update product cost
```

**After (FIFO):**

```
Receive Stock → Create New Batch → Update product totals

Example:
Receive 100 units @ ₱6.00
- Creates Batch #003
- Batch number: AUTO-20251025-123
- Product stock: 30 → 130
- Average cost: ₱5.67 (for reference)
```

---

### 6. **UI Updates**

**Receive Stock Dialog:**

- Shows existing batches in FIFO order
- Displays batch details
- Preview: total stock, batch count, average cost
- Success confirmation with batch info

**Batch List Widget:**

- Visual batch display
- FIFO order indicator
- Progress bars for sell-through
- "FIFO NEXT" label on oldest batch
- Depleted batch markers

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Exact Cost Tracking

- Every unit has exact purchase cost
- No averaging across different purchases
- Perfect for products with fluctuating costs

### 2. FIFO Enforcement

- System automatically uses oldest stock first
- Ensures proper stock rotation
- Prevents old stock accumulation

### 3. Fixed Pricing Option

- Set `sellingPrice` on product (optional)
- Price stays fixed even when costs change
- Profit margin varies based on batch cost

### 4. Multi-Batch Sales

- Single sale can span multiple batches
- Each batch tracked separately in sale items
- Accurate COGS calculation

### 5. Batch Performance

- Track sell-through by batch
- Identify slow-moving batches
- Analyze supplier performance

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Coffee Shop - Coke 1L

**Initial State:**

- No stock

**Day 1: Receive Stock**

```
Action: Receive 10 units @ ₱100
Result:
  ✓ Batch #001 created
  ✓ Stock: 10 units
  ✓ Average cost: ₱100
```

**Day 5: Receive More Stock (Higher Price)**

```
Action: Receive 20 units @ ₱120
Result:
  ✓ Batch #002 created
  ✓ Stock: 30 units
  ✓ Average cost: ₱113.33 (for reference)

Batches in FIFO order:
1. Batch #001: 10 units @ ₱100 (Oct 1) ← FIFO NEXT
2. Batch #002: 20 units @ ₱120 (Oct 5)
```

**Day 7: Sale - Customer buys 15 Coke**

```
FIFO Allocation:
  1. Take 10 from Batch #001 @ ₱100
  2. Take 5 from Batch #002 @ ₱120

Sale Items Created:
  - Item 1: 10 units @ ₱150 (selling) with cost ₱100
  - Item 2: 5 units @ ₱150 (selling) with cost ₱120

Revenue: 15 × ₱150 = ₱2,250
COGS: (10 × ₱100) + (5 × ₱120) = ₱1,600
Profit: ₱650

After Sale:
  ✓ Batch #001: 0 units (DEPLETED)
  ✓ Batch #002: 15 units @ ₱120 ← FIFO NEXT
  ✓ Stock: 15 units
```

**Day 10: Price Increase - Receive Stock**

```
Action: Receive 30 units @ ₱130
Result:
  ✓ Batch #003 created
  ✓ Stock: 45 units
  ✓ Average cost: ₱126.67

Batches:
1. Batch #001: DEPLETED
2. Batch #002: 15 units @ ₱120 (Oct 5) ← FIFO NEXT
3. Batch #003: 30 units @ ₱130 (Oct 10)
```

**Day 12: Large Sale - 40 units**

```
FIFO Allocation:
  1. Take 15 from Batch #002 @ ₱120 (all remaining)
  2. Take 25 from Batch #003 @ ₱130

COGS: (15 × ₱120) + (25 × ₱130) = ₱5,050
```

---

## 🆚 Comparison: WAC vs FIFO

### Same Scenario with OLD WAC System:

**After all transactions:**

- Stock: 45 units
- Cost: ₱126.67 (average)

**Large Sale (40 units):**

```
WAC System:
  ✗ COGS: 40 × ₱126.67 = ₱5,067
  ✗ Single sale item
  ✗ Can't identify which batch was sold
```

**FIFO System:**

```
FIFO System:
  ✓ COGS: (15 × ₱120) + (25 × ₱130) = ₱5,050
  ✓ Multiple sale items (exact batches)
  ✓ Know exactly which stock was sold
  ✓ Can trace back to supplier
```

**Difference:** ₱17 more accurate!

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test these scenarios:

### Basic Flow

- [ ] Receive stock creates batch ✓
- [ ] Make sale uses FIFO ✓
- [ ] Complete sale reduces batch ✓

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Product with zero stock
- [ ] Sale quantity > single batch
- [ ] All batches depleted
- [ ] Multiple receipts same day

### Migration

- [ ] Upgrade from v8 to v9 works
- [ ] Existing stock becomes initial batch
- [ ] Old sales data preserved
- [ ] Reports still work

### UI

- [ ] Batch list displays correctly
- [ ] FIFO indicator shows on oldest
- [ ] Progress bars accurate
- [ ] Receive dialog previews right

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Testing Phase
